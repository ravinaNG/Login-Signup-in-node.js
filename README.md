# Login/Signup node.js
#### This project I did is to basically undertand the practical concept of promisses and callback.

## What it does:-
- Sign-up:-
  - will ask for userName
  -will check if the userName is exist in our jsonFile(Database)
  - if it's exist it will tell userName is already exist
  - if it's not exist it will ask to enter password
  - first password and conformation password
  - and it'll alos check password validation
  - validatio - @ or # should be there and atleast one number should be there
